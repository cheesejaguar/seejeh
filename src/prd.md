**AI Controls**: Integrated into existing settings panel
**Difficulty Selector**: Radio buttons with descriptive labels
**AI Status**: Minimal progress indicators during move calculation
**Mode Toggle**: Clear switch between Human vs Human and Human vs AI

## Implementation Considerations

### AI Architecture
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Enhanced decision-making with alpha-beta pruning and configurable depth
- **Evaluation Functions**: Multi-layered position scoring including stone count, mobility, center control, and strategic positioning
- **Difficulty Scaling**: 
  - Beginner (depth 1, basic evaluation, occasional suboptimal moves)
  - Easy (depth 2, basic evaluation with minor strategic considerations)
  - Medium (depth 3, improved evaluation with positional awareness)
  - Hard (depth 4-5, advanced evaluation with opening book and endgame optimization)
- **Opening Book**: Pre-computed optimal opening moves for higher difficulties
- **Endgame Tables**: Specialized logic for winning/drawing positions with few pieces

### Performance Requirements
- AI moves completed within 1-3 seconds maximum
- Responsive UI during AI calculation
- Smooth integration with existing game flow

### State Management
- Default to Human vs AI mode (no human vs human option)
- AI difficulty persistence across sessions
- Game analysis and move history for learning review
- Optional hint system for human players

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

**AI Calculation Timeout**: Fallback to simpler evaluation if moves take too long
**Invalid AI Moves**: Comprehensive validation and error recovery
**Game State Corruption**: AI moves must maintain game rule integrity
**User Experience**: Clear indicators when AI is "thinking" vs ready for human input

## Reflection

This AI-focused implementation transforms Seejeh from a traditional two-player game into a sophisticated single-player learning experience. The progressive difficulty system and optional strategic guidance create an educational journey that helps players master this ancient game's deep strategic principles while preserving its cultural authenticity.
